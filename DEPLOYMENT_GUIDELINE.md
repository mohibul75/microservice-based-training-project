# Deployment Guideline for Event-Driven System using Docker Compose

## Overview
This guideline provides an overview of deploying an event-driven system using Docker Compose. The system includes multiple microservices, RabbitMQ for messaging, PostgreSQL for the database, Redis for caching, and Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana for monitoring and logging.

## Services to Include in Docker Compose

1. **User Management Service**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.

2. **Event Management Service**
   - Manages event creation, updates, and deletions. Allows event organizers to list their events.

3. **Booking Service**
   - Manages ticket booking, availability, and cancellations.

4. **Payment Service**
   - Handles payment processing and refunds for bookings.

5. **Notification Service**
   - Sends notifications to users for booking confirmations, reminders, and updates.

6. **Review and Rating Service**
   - Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for events they attended.

7. **RabbitMQ**
   - Provides messaging functionality for asynchronous communication between services.

8. **PostgreSQL**
   - Serves as the relational database for storing application data.

9. **Redis**
   - Provides caching functionality to improve performance and reduce database load.

10. **Prometheus**
    - Monitors and collects metrics from services.

11. **Loki**
    - Collects and aggregates logs from the services.

12. **Grafana**
    - Provides a visualization platform for metrics and logs collected by Prometheus and Loki.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

2. **Create a Docker Compose File**
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that includes the configurations for all services listed above.

3. **Configure Prometheus**
   - Create a Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) to specify the metrics to be scraped.

4. **Configure Loki**
   - Create a Loki configuration file (`loki-config.yml`) to specify the log collection settings.

5. **Start the Services**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all the services in detached mode.

6. **Access the Services**
   - Access RabbitMQ at [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672).
   - Access Prometheus at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
   - Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (default login: `admin` / `admin`).

7. **Configure Grafana**
   - Log in to Grafana and configure data sources for Prometheus and Loki.
   - Create dashboards for visualizing metrics and logs.

## Benefits

- **Modularity:** Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Scalability:** Microservices architecture allows for efficient scaling of individual components based on load.
- **Maintainability:** Independent services with clear boundaries make the system easier to maintain and update.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrated monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana ensure robust observability.

This deployment guideline ensures a comprehensive and scalable setup for an event-driven system using Docker Compose.
