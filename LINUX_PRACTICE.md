# Linux Skills Evaluation Guidelines for DevOps Training

## Overview
This guideline provides a structured approach to evaluate the Linux skills of DevOps trainees. It focuses on practical tasks involving the creation and management of `systemd` service files, along with other key Linux administration concepts. The goal is to assess the trainees' proficiency in essential Linux tasks and their ability to manage system services.

## Evaluation Areas

### 1. Creating and Managing `systemd` Service Files

#### Objectives
- Assess the ability to create and configure `systemd` service files.
- Evaluate the understanding of service management commands.
- Test knowledge of configuring services to start on boot, check status, and manage logs.

#### Tasks
- Create a `systemd` service file for a sample application.
- Reload the `systemd` daemon.
- Enable and disable the service to start on boot.
- Start, stop, and check the status of the service.
- View service logs using `journalctl`.

### 2. User and Group Management

#### Objectives
- Evaluate the ability to create, modify, and delete users and groups.
- Assess knowledge of user and group permissions.

#### Tasks
- Create new user accounts and groups.
- Modify existing user accounts and group memberships.
- Delete user accounts and groups.
- Assign and modify user and group permissions for files and directories.

### 3. File System and Directory Management

#### Objectives
- Test the ability to navigate and manage the file system.
- Assess knowledge of file and directory permissions.

#### Tasks
- Navigate the file system using basic commands.
- Create, delete, move, and copy files and directories.
- Change file and directory permissions and ownership.
- Use symbolic and hard links.

### 4. Networking

#### Objectives
- Evaluate the understanding of basic networking commands and concepts.
- Assess the ability to configure and troubleshoot network settings.

#### Tasks
- Display and configure network interfaces.
- Test network connectivity using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `netstat`.
- Configure hostname and DNS settings.
- Manage firewall rules using tools like `iptables` or `firewalld`.

### 5. System Monitoring and Performance

#### Objectives
- Assess knowledge of monitoring system performance and processes.
- Evaluate the ability to use system monitoring tools.

#### Tasks
- Monitor system performance using tools like `top`, `htop`, and `vmstat`.
- Check system logs for errors or unusual activity.
- Use process management commands like `ps`, `kill`, and `nice`.

### 6. Package Management

#### Objectives
- Test the ability to install, update, and remove software packages.
- Evaluate knowledge of package management tools.

#### Tasks
- Install, update, and remove packages using package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`.
- Search for packages and check package details.
- Manage package repositories and keys.

## Best Practices for Evaluation

- **Clear Instructions:** Provide clear and concise instructions for each task.
- **Documentation:** Encourage trainees to refer to relevant documentation and manuals.
- **Hands-on Tasks:** Focus on practical, hands-on tasks to assess real-world skills.
- **Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback to help trainees improve their skills.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent evaluation criteria for all trainees.

## Conclusion
This guideline outlines a comprehensive approach to evaluate the Linux skills of DevOps trainees. By focusing on practical tasks and essential Linux administration concepts, you can effectively assess the trainees' proficiency and readiness for real-world DevOps challenges.
